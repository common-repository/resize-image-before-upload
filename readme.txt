Plugin settings are located under "Media" tab ("Resize before upload"), there you can configure:

- Max image size in pixels (The images bigger than this threshold are scaled down to it);
- Use WP-compat (old) assets uploading script.
- A setting to enable / disable on front end / admin part separately.
